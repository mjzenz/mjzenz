- I'm interested in systems of political governance and (more recently) education analytics.
- I have a PhD in Philosophy from the University of Maryland, where I focused on conceptual problems with the measurement of public opinion and its relevance to governance
- I primarily code in R and SQL, although I also have experience in Java, Python, and C++.
- I current work as a Policy and Planning Analyst at the University of Wisconsin - Madison.
